Unfold
======

The ``Unfold`` transform unfolds (pivots) a set of columns. Simple unfolding consists of rotating a single input columns into multiple output columns. 
This can be generalised to multiple input columns where the output columns
are broken up into equal-sized groups, each of which is generated from one of the input columns. 
Its arguments are:

* *pipeline* The input pipeline (required).
* *inputs* The list of columns to be unfolded. They will be dropped from the output, so use ``Copy`` to preserve them. 
  Each input column represents an output group.
* *outputs* The output columns receiving the unfolded columns. The output columns are broken into equal-sized groups, one per input column. 
  The number of *inputs* must be an even multiple of the number of *outputs*.

``Unfold`` is the inverse of ``Fold``. 

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^
The current implementation assumes that the unfolded values are contiguous. 
That is, all the input rows for a single output row will arrive sequentially and in order.
This is the order generated by ``Fold``, so it is suggested that for now ``Unfold`` 
only be used to undo the actions of ``Fold``

Examples:
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python
  
   Unfold(p, ('Year', 'Sales',), ('Sales 1992', 'Sales 1993', 'Sales 1994',))
   Unfold(p, ('Year', 'Sales', 'Profit',), ('Sales 1992', 'Sales 1993', 'Sales 1994', 'Profit 1992', 'Profit 1993', 'Profit 1994',))
